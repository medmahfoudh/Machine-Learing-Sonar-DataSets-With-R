# Machine-Learing-Sonar-DataSets-With-R
Project Machine Learning With R 


we will use the Sonar dataset (signals) from the library
mlbench. Sonar is a system for detecting objects underwater and measuring the
water depth by emitting sound pulses and detecting them. The full description is
found in mlbench. For our purposes, this is a two-class classification task (class R and
class M) with numerical data
